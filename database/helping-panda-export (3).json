Eventually I thought of having a blanket distribution drive.\n\nOne Blanket will cost between 322-379 rupees. With this amount we plan to distribute 50 blankets throughout Bangalore to the homeless people. \n\nThere are many homeless people that don’t have shelter during the current situation and it’s very cold outside lately. So seeing this I thought that I can contribute blankets to keep them warm during these cold nights of winter. I need your financial help to reach my goal of 50 blankets and help them keep them warm. These are the homeless who have no one. I request and urge you to donate as much as possible.",
